### Introduction & Motivation  
     The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it many challenges in the sports world. Sports have always
revolved around the fans, but unfortunately, events involving fans often result in “super-spreader” events
that worsen the pandemic. The National Basketball Association (NBA) was one of many sport leagues
that had their season interrupted by the pandemic. Their solution was to implement a contained,
quarantined environment in Orlando, Florida called the “Bubble”, where game-play could continue under
strict precautionary procedures.  
     In this investigation, we were interested in comparing NBA player performance inside and outside
the Bubble. The Bubble provided a contrast to the usual regime of home and away games. Since all
teams competed on the same court without fan presence, it is conceivable that the effect of home and
away games on player performance might have changed in the Bubble. For a few players, this perceived
difference between their normal play and their Bubble play seemed especially pronounced. These
differences were seized upon by the media and developed into influential narratives that shaped the
2020 NBA postseason. As such, we were particularly interested in assessing whether the Bubble effect
was real for these specific players, and whether these effects conform to the media narrative.  
     The primary objective of our investigation was to identify the effects of home and Bubble games
on player performance. The Bubble provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine the impact of
fans and packed arenas on professional sport outcomes by providing a controlled, identical setting for
competition. Using a full factorial design, we tested the significance and magnitude of playing at home,
playing in the Bubble, and their interaction.
